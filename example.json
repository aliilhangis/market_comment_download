When I downloaded it and opened it, I liked the content that was on offer, but when I tried to subscribe, my subscription never showed up, and I couldn’t restore it from The iTunes Store. Therefore, I never had it show up in the app that I even had a paid subscription. You really need to fix this for your subscribers. Thank God I was using a gift card and didn’t actually pay 14.99 a month of my own money for that subscription with taxes that actually came out to a little over $16 a month.",
